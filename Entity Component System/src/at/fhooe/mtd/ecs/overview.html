	<h1>Entity Component System</h1>

	<p>
		This <em>Entity Component System</em> (ECS) represents a manageable
		set of classes and interfaces that realize a component-based entity
		management for interactive applications and games.
	</p>

	<p>
		The ECS does not contain any references to other external packages or
		libraries and can be used together with any game or graphics library
		to created applications that need entity management. However, due to
		the fact that is was originally intended to be used together with the
		<em>Simple Game Library</em> (SGL), it follows the intention and
		spirit of SGL. This means that the way it is implemented is more
		dedicated to idea of being readable and comprehensible and not of
		being the fastest component system on this planet.
	</p>
	<p>Nonetheless, ECS happened to turn out as usable and fast-enough
		component system in each and every case of its reported usage. In
		almost any case where performance issues need to be addressed, the
		component-system is unlikely to be the bottleneck.</p>

	<p>If you tend to disagree regarding these performance
		considerations, this is perfectly fine - but please do not tell us or
		start a discussion. Go ahead and use another component-system and be
		happy with it and so are we.</p>
